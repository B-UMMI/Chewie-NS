# About Chewie-NS

## Welcome

Chewie-NS is a web-based Nomenclature Server, based on the 
[TypOn ontology](https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-1480-5-43),
that integrates with the [chewBBACA suite](https://github.com/B-UMMI/chewBBACA) to provide a centralized service to download or update schemas, allowing the easy sharing of results, while ensuring the reproducibility and consistency of these steps.

Chewie-NS is developed by the [Molecular Microbiology and Infection Unit (UMMI)](http://darwin.phyloviz.net/wiki/doku.php) at the [Instituto de Medicina Molecular JoÃ£o Lobo Antunes](https://imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/).

## Goals

With this service we have following main goals:

1. Providing a public and centralised web service to manage typing schemas.
2. Establish a common nomenclature for allele calling.
3. Ensure the reproducibility and consistency of wg/cgMLST analysis.
