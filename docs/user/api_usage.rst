API Usage
=========

.. warning::
  - API POST requests need to be authenticated with a valid API Token.
  - The API exists to be used; if you have suggestions for how to make it more useful for you, let us know.
  - Please be responsible, do not flood the server with requests - add a 1-2 second pause.
  - Do not try to download 'all' schema data.
  - People who abuse the system, first offense: will be warned, second offense: their API access will be revoked, third offense: Banned from Chewie-NS.

For more information on uploading and/or downloading schemas please read :doc:`chewbbaca`.

.. Populate the database
.. ---------------------

.. When the local instance of Chewie-NS is up and running, the database will only have the admin user, so you need to add some data
.. in order to start using Chewie-NS. For that read :doc:`../user/add_data_db`.
