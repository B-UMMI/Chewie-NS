About Chewie-NS
===============

Welcome!
::::::::

Chewie-NS is a web-based Nomenclature Server, based on the 
`TypOn ontology <https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-1480-5-43>`_,
that integrates with the `chewBBACA suite <https://github.com/B-UMMI/chewBBACA>`_
to provide a centralized service to download or update schemas, allowing the 
easy sharing of results, while ensuring the reproducibility and consistency 
of these steps. 

Chewie-NS is developed by the `Molecular Microbiology and Infection Unit (UMMI) 
<http://darwin.phyloviz.net/wiki/doku.php>`_ at the 
`Instituto de Medicina Molecular João Lobo Antunes 
<https://imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/>`_.

Goals
:::::

With this service we have following main goals:

1. Providing a public and centralised web service to manage typing schemas.
2. Establish a common nomenclature for allele calling.
3. Ensure the reproducibility and consistency of wg/cgMLST analysis.
