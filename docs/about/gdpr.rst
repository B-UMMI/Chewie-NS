How Chewie-NS uses your personal data (GDPR)
============================================

The `General Data Protection Regulation <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/eu-data-protection-rules_en>`_ 
is an EU regulation that was set up in 2016 and came into force on 25th May 2018. 
These rules give people the explicit right to know what websites and companies are 
doing with their personal information (e.g. how it is stored, how it is processed, 
or shared with third parties). These regulations also explicitly give people a say 
in how their information is used.

We feel these are important issues and wish to clarify what happens within Chewie-NS 
in relation to the GDPR.
